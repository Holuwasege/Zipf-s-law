# Zipf-s-law
Zipf's law is an empirical observation stating that the frequency of a word in a language is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency distribution of that language. In simpler terms, the most frequent word appears approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third, and so on.
